### A note to my fellow Code Institute students

I am happy that you have come to look at my readme as an example of how to write a good one for your second Milestone project. You are welcome to learn how to structure and format your own readme from mine.

However, it is not ok to copy and paste large portions of it into your own project. Please remember to write your own readme yourself, rather than copying mine or someone elses.

Many thanks! Anna
