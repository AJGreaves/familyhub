    "description": "SPORTS IS FUN FOR ALL AGES\r\n\r\nBroSports provides fun and varied sports lessons for all kinds of target groups. Every lesson is supervised by professional trainers and supervisors.\r\n\r\nSport is usually played in the sports halls, but if the weather permits, also outside.\r\n\r\nTODDLER SPORTS\r\n\r\nExercising is fun. And the fun in sports starts at BroSports early. They help children with the basic forms of exercise. Such as walking, rolling, diving, throwing & catching, climbing, aiming, waving and jumping. Toddlers' sport is given in 2 groups. For kids from 1.5 to 3 years and for kids from 2.5 to 4 years. These lessons are on Saturday and Sunday. Berrie de Beer is always there to encourage the children.\r\n\r\nTODDLER FOOTBALL\r\n\r\nOften you can only play football at a sports club when you are 5 years old. But you can go to BroSports earlier. During Pannapeuters / Toddler Football they will learn the skills of football in a challenging and playful way. The toddlers steal the show in their own outfit and with their own ball. That becomes scoring. Really!\r\n\r\nBERRIE DE BEER\r\n\r\nBerrie is the enthusiastic help during the sports lessons. He is sweet, caring and always likes to participate in the exercises or encourages the children. Berrie acts as a bridge between the supervisors and the children.",

    "description": "Learn to swim with Jip.\r\n\r\nThe children learn to swim at swimming pool De Waterkanten in Lisse according to the Swimming ABC. Jip, a cartoon hippo, is central to these lessons. With Jip your child learns to swim step by step. Jip motivates your child to go a little further. Your child will be taught in a safe and fun way and will work purposefully towards the A, B and C diploma!\r\n\r\nHow does a lesson go?\r\n\r\nEvery lesson your child practices different parts to be able to swim safely and well. This way your child learns how to use water in different ways (jumping, turning, going under water and floating). Your child will go one step further per lesson. We start with the breaststroke, only then the chest and back crawl are discussed.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe content of the lessons is based on the following three principles:\r\n \r\nMotivation\r\n\r\nThe program has a planned approach with an individual transfer option to the next level. The aim is to encourage every child as much as possible within his / her capabilities.\r\n\r\nSwimming fun\r\n\r\nWater is fun! You get wet, you can play fun games in it and you can swim in it! De Waterkanten swimming pool in Lisse wants to give that feeling to every child. This requires certain skills. They try to connect as much as possible with the world of living and thinking and take the age of your child into account when learning to swim. You will find that also during the swimming lessons when offering the exercise material. De Waterkanten swimming pool is very important to learning how to swim.\r\n\r\nAt the first swimming lesson your child will receive a starter package with a number of items from Jip (the cartoon hippo), including the first red wristband. To motivate children, they can earn a total of eight wristbands (when they complete the Swim ABC). The colors of the bands correspond to the level groups. As soon as your child meets the requirements to go to the next group, your child will receive a wristband.\r\n \r\nSwimming safety\r\n\r\nDe Waterkanten Sports Fund believes it is important that your child feels completely free in the water. For this, it learns how to use water in different ways. Skills such as going under water, breathing, floating, turning and turning, jumping, moving and dressed swimming are learned early in a playful way.\r\n\r\nIf your child has mastered the above skills in different water depths, he can move safely and freely in the water. This way your child will feel safe and can enjoy swimming, water and the associated attractions without fear.",
